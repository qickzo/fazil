Beautiful is better than ugly.


Explicit is better than implicit.


Simple is better than complex.


Complex is better than complicated.


Readability counts.
The 
assignment
 statement, using a single equals sign 
=
.


The 
if
 statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with 
else
 and 
elif
 (a contraction of else-if).


The 
for
 statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.


The 
while
 statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.


The 
try
 statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by 
except
 clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a 
finally
 block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.


The 
raise
 statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.


The 
class
 statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a 
class
, for use in 
object-oriented programming
.


The 
def
 statement, which defines a 
function
 or 
method
.


The 
with
 statement, from Python 2.5 released in September 2006,
[81]
 which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a 
lock
 before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a 
file
 and then closing it), allowing 
resource-acquisition-is-initialization
 (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.
[82]


The 
break
 statement, exits from a loop.


The 
continue
 statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.


The 
del
 statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned.


The 
pass
 statement, which serves as a 
NOP
. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.


The 
assert
 statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.


The 
yield
 statement, which returns a value from a 
generator
 function. From Python 2.5, 
yield
 is also an operator. This form is used to implement 
coroutines
.


The 
return
 statement, used to return a value from a function.


The 
import
 statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using 
import
:

import
 
<
module
 
name
>
 
[
as
 
<
alias
>
]


from
 
<
module
 
name
>
 
import
 
*


from
 
<
module
 
name
>
 
import
 
<
definition
 
1
>
 
[
as
 
<
alias
 
1
>
],
 
<
definition
 
2
>
 
[
as
 
<
alias
 
2
>
],
 
...
.
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) 
//
 and floating-point
/
division.
[87]
 Python also uses the 
**
 operator for exponentiation.


From Python 3.5, the new 
@
 infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as 
NumPy
 for 
matrix multiplication
.
[88]
[89]


From Python 3.8, the syntax 
:=
, called the 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.
[90]


In Python, 
==
 compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value
[91]
 and objects by reference.
[92]
 (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the 
equals()
 method.) Python's 
is
 operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example 
a
 
<=
 
b
 
<=
 
c
.


Python uses the words 
and
, 
or
, 
not
 for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic 
&&
, 
||
, 
!
 used in Java and C.


Python has a type of expression termed a 
list comprehension
 as well as a more general expression termed a 
generator
 expression
.
[66]


Anonymous functions
 are implemented using 
lambda expressions
; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.


Conditional expressions in Python are written as 
x
 
if
 
c
 
else
 
y
[93]
 (different in order of operands from the 
c ? x : y
 operator common to many other languages).


Python makes a distinction between 
lists
 and 
tuples
. Lists are written as 
[
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
]
, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be 
immutable
 in Python). Tuples are written as 
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
)
, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The 
+
 operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable 
t
 initially equal to 
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
)
, executing 
t
 
=
 
t
 
+
 
(
4
,
 
5
)
 first evaluates 
t
 
+
 
(
4
,
 
5
)
, which yields 
(
1
,
 
2
,
 
3
,
 
4
,
 
5
)
, which is then assigned back to 
t
, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of 
t
, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.
[94]


Python features 
sequence unpacking
 wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an 
iterable
 object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.
[95]


Python has a "string format" operator 
%
. This functions analogously to 
printf
 format strings in 
C
, e.g. 
"spam=
%s
 eggs=
%d
"
 
%
 
(
"blah"
,
 
2
)
 evaluates to 
"spam=blah eggs=2"
. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the 
format()
 method of the 
str
 class, e.g. 
"spam=
{0}
 eggs=
{1}
"
.
format
(
"blah"
,
 
2
)
. Python 3.6 added "f-strings": 
blah
 
=
 
"blah"
;
 
eggs
 
=
 
2
;
 
f
'spam=
{
blah
}
 eggs=
{
eggs
}
'
.
[96]


Strings in Python can be 
concatenated
, by "adding" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. 
"spam"
 
+
 
"eggs"
 returns 
"spameggs"
. Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. 
"2"
 
+
 
"2"
 returns 
"22"
.


Python has various kinds of 
string literals
:

Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in 
Unix shells
, 
Perl
 and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (
\
) as an 
escape character
. 
String interpolation
 became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".
[96]


Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like 
here documents
 in shells, Perl and 
Ruby
.


Raw string
 varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an 
r
. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as 
regular expressions
 and 
Windows
-style paths. Compare "
@
-quoting" in 
C#
.


Python has 
array index
 and 
array slicing
 expressions on lists, denoted as 
a[key]
, 
a
[
start
:
stop
]
 or 
a
[
start
:
stop
:
step
]
. Indexes are 
zero-based
, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the 
start
 index up to, but not including, the 
stop
 index. The third slice parameter, called 
step
 or 
stride
, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example 
a
[:]
 returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a 
shallow copy
.
Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in 
Unix shells
, 
Perl
 and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (
\
) as an

.

List comprehensions
 vs. 
for
-loops


Conditional
 expressions vs. 
if
 blocks


The 
eval()
 vs. 
exec()
 built-in functions (in Python 2, 
exec
 is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.
Python 2.1 and earlier used C's division behavior. The 
/
 operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 
7
/
3
 
==
 
2
 and 
-
7
/
3
 
==
 
-
2
.


Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 
7/3 == 2
 and 
-7/3 == -3
. The floor division 
//
 operator was introduced. So 
7//3 == 2
, 
-7//3 == -3
, 
7.5//3 == 2.0
 and 
-7.5//3 == -3.0
. Adding 
from
 
__future__
 
import
 
division
 causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).


Python 3.0 changed 
/
 to always be floating-point division, e.g. 
5
/
2
 
==
 
2.5
.

just-in-time compiler
 brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it.
[132]
[133]


Stackless Python
 is a significant fork of CPython that implements 
microthreads
; it does not use the 
call stack
 in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.
[134]


MicroPython
 and 
CircuitPython
 are Python 3 variants optimized for 
microcontrollers
, including 
Lego Mindstorms EV3
.
[135]


Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.
[136]


Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time 
JIT
 and an experimental bytecode compiler.
[137]
Google began a project named 
Unladen Swallow
 in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the 
LLVM
, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,
[138]
 while ordinary implementations suffer from the 
global interpreter lock
.


Psyco
 is a discontinued 
just-in-time
 
specializing
 compiler (which didn't support Python 2.7 or later) that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain 
data types
 and is faster than the standard Python code.
PyS60
 was a Python 2 interpreter for 
Series 60
 mobile phones released by 
Nokia
 in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the 
Symbian
 operating system. The Nokia 
N900
 also supports Python with 
GTK
 widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.
[139]
Cython
 compiles (a superset of) Python 2.7 to 
C
 (while the resulting code is also usable with Python 3 and also e.g. 
C++
).

 compiles Python into C++.
[140]


Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to 
C++
.

transpiles
 Python 2 to 
Go
.
[144]
[145]
[146]


IronPython
 (now abandoned by Microsoft) allows running Python 2.7 programs on the .NET 
Common Language Runtime
.
[147]


Jython
 compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.
[148]


MyHDL
 is a Python-based 
hardware description language
 (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to 
Verilog
 or 
VHDL
 code.


Numba
 uses 
LLVM
 to compile a subset of Python to machine code.


Brython,
[149]
 Transcrypt
[150]
[151]
 and 
Pyjs
 (latest release in 2012) compile Python to 
JavaScript
.


RPython
 can be compiled to 
C
, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.
Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually 
ported
. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.


Major or "feature" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.
[158]
[159]
 They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.
[160]


Bugfix releases,
[161]
 which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.
[161]
Boo
 uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.
[206]


Cobra
 uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its 
Acknowledgements
 document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.
[207]


CoffeeScript
, a 
programming language
 that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.


ECMAScript
/
JavaScript
 borrowed 
iterators
 and 
generators
 from Python.
[208]


GDScript
, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the 
Godot
 game engine.
[209]


Go
 is designed for the "speed of working in a dynamic language like Python"
[210]
 and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.


Groovy
 was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to 
Java
.
[211]


Julia
 was designed to be "as usable for general programming as Python".
[25]


Nim
 uses indentation and similar syntax.
[212]


Ruby
's creator, 
Yukihiro Matsumoto
, has said: "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."
[213]


Swift
, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.
